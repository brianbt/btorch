# BTorch
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/btorch/badge/?version=latest)](https://btorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)  
BTorch is a PyTorch's useful utils library

## Requiements
PyTorch â‰¥ 1.10

## Install
`pip install git+https://github.com/brianbt/btorch`
## High Level Module (nn.Module)
You can use `btorch.nn` as normal `torch.nn` with more useful functions.  
You can define your model by subclassing it from `btorch.nn.Module` and everythings will be same as subclassing from `torch.nn.Module`.  
`btorch.nn.Module` provides you high-level training loop that you can define by yourself. Making the code more clean while maintain the flexibilityof PyTorch.  

The high-level methods are  
- .fit()  
- .train_net()  
- .train_epoch()  
- .test_epoch()  

Override them when necessary and train your model by just calling `.fit()`

## Inherent Library
You can import below library and use that as pyTorch
```
from btorch import nn
import btorch.nn.functional as F
from btorch.vision import models
```
